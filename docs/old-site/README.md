#### Old Site Documentation

This folder contains documentation from the previous iteration of the site

### IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES

Our current goals for the new application include

* Reworking the attendence workflow to be much, much simpler
* Skipping the extra step of "verifying" the information after it is entered

Things we are not working on:

* Not implementing quizzes
* Not working on banner messages / message of the day messages
* Not working on links or other external information

If you find yourself starting to work on any of the above, please stop.

We're also not currently working on dividends at the moment. Maybe someday we'll be ready to add this to the system, though.
